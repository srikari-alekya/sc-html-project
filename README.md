The website has been created taking reference from  Street Cause which is one of the largest run NGO'S in hyderabad. Being Vice president of Street Cause GNITS(G Narayanamma Institue of Technology and Science) division, I made an attempt to create a basic html website for street cause.Akhilesh Jukareddy established Street Cause in 2009 at the Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology, Hyderabad, with a vision of serving humankind with a group of like-minded individuals who are passionately driven by one cause: "A life without a cause is a life without an effect".
